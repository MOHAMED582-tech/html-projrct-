<p>
    Mobile Computing has 3-tier architecture with various its functions, in which include major three segments are:

    <ol>
        <li>Data access layer</li>
        <li>Application tire in middle line</li>
        <li>Client tier on the surface</li>
    </ol>
    Each tier is spitted in many network and not require any physical location on all terminals on the network.
    <ul>
        <li><u>Presentation Layer</u></li>
        This layer provides data to the user and allows to data feeding and manipulation, and proceeds all data as Business layer.
        <li><u>Business Logic Layer</u></li>
        Business logic work as a server for user requests from work point. This works according to bringing or entering business rules through the data layer.
        <li><u>Data Acceayess Layer</u></li>
        This layer work as DBMS access layer because this layer provides data to other two layers. Allow dependencies on the storage area can be done updation.
    </ul>
