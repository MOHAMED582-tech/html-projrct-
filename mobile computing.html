    <b>it is a technology that allows transmission of data, voice and video via a computer or any other wireless enabled device without having to be connected to a fixed physical link. The main concept involves Mobile communication. Mobile hardware.<p>
    
<h2><i>How does it work ?</i></h2>
<p>Mobile computing is the idea that users can process data or perform digital tasks on mobile devices. This broad category of operations is made possible by several new innovations in information technology over the past decade.

    Mobile computing starts with the actual hardware inside a smartphone. A microprocessor powers mobile computing, and memory chips provide for data storage. A radio frequency element handles power sourcing and other proprietary telecom technology sends outgoing signals and receives incoming signals from a 3G or 4G wireless network.
    
    The wireless networks carry the data where it needs to go. Traditionally, data was routed through cell towers in a particular provide physical network to another user phone. With modern mobile computing, data is also often delivered onto the Internet via the provide telecom network. This hybrid system is part of what accommodates mobile computing, where users can access individual Internet sites over their smartphones.
    
    With recent advances in mobile computing, users can now perform mobile computing on their smartphones while completing phone calls. This technology involves parallel processing of different threads for digital voice and data operations. Modern smartphones are a lot like computers, with their own operating systems and sophisticated logical infrastructure, which facilitates more advanced mobile computing and the proliferation of mobile applications or "apps" for a multitude of functions and uses.
